# Data-visualization-with-python
This repository contains Python code for data visualization exercises using the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. It demonstrates the creation of various plot types, including line plots, scatter plots, and bar charts.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Line Plot of City Populations
This exercise creates a line plot showing the population growth of four different cities over time.
* **Libraries:** Matplotlib
* **Data:**
    * City A: `[500000, 550000, 600000, 650000, 700000, 750000, 800000]`
    * City B: `[800000, 850000, 900000, 950000, 1000000, 1050000, 1100000]`
    * City C: `[1000000, 1050000, 1100000, 1150000, 1200000, 1250000, 1300000]`
    * City D: `[1200000, 1250000, 1300000, 1350000, 1400000, 1450000, 1500000]`
    * Years: `[2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016]`
      
### Exercise 2: Scatter Plot of Hours Studied vs. Test Scores

This exercise creates a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the number of hours studied and the test scores obtained by students.

* **Libraries:** Seaborn, Matplotlib
* **Data:**
    * Hours Studied: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`
    * Test Scores: `[93, 57, 61, 54, 51, 53, 87, 81, 83, 85]`

### Exercise 3: Bar Chart of Monthly Sales

This exercise creates a bar chart to display the total sales for each month of the year.

* **Libraries:** Matplotlib
* **Data:**
    * Months: `["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"]`
    * Sales: `[11860, 10480, 4997, 5523, 13965, 6011, 13158, 9533, 5158, 9058, 11346, 6675]`
